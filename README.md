# Web3 Dapp Template

An opinionated, slim app packaged with some of my favourite tools for building web3 appss

## Getting Started

### Install

```
pnpm i
```

### Development server

```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
